## ü•á PROJECT #1: Crime Prediction Model (1.5 hours) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Why This First?
- Combines ML + GIS (your two main niches)
- Impressive to recruiters
- Relatively quick to implement
- Great portfolio piece

### What to Build
```
1. Get crime dataset (free from Kaggle)
2. Train ML model to predict high-crime areas
3. Create interactive map showing predictions
4. Deploy live demo
```

### Step-by-Step
```
Step 1: Download Dataset (5 min)
- Go to Kaggle.com
- Search "Crime Data" 
- Download Nigerian or Lagos crime data

Step 2: Build Model (30 min)
- Python script with scikit-learn
- Train Random Forest or XGBoost
- Get ~80%+ accuracy

Step 3: Create Map Visualization (30 min)
- Use Folium or Leaflet
- Show predictions on interactive map
- Color-coded risk levels (Red, Orange, Yellow)

Step 4: Deploy & Document (20 min)
- Push to GitHub
- Create README with explanation
- Add to portfolio admin
```

### Code Framework
```python
# crime_prediction.py
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import folium

# 1. Load data
crime_data = pd.read_csv('crime_data.csv')

# 2. Prepare features
X = crime_data[['latitude', 'longitude', 'month', 'day_of_week']]
y = crime_data['crime_type']

# 3. Train model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 4. Make predictions on grid
import numpy as np
grid_lats = np.linspace(6.0, 7.0, 50)  # Lagos latitude range
grid_lons = np.linspace(3.0, 3.5, 50)  # Lagos longitude range
predictions = model.predict([[lat, lon, 1, 1] for lat in grid_lats for lon in grid_lons])

# 5. Create map
map_crime = folium.Map(location=[6.5, 3.25], zoom_start=11)
# Add prediction layers
folium.save('crime_map.html')
```

### Portfolio Entry
```
Title: Crime Prediction Model
Category: Machine Learning / GIS
