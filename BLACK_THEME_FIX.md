**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Commit:** 843f513  
**Status:** ✅ PUSHED TO GITHUB - VERCEL DEPLOYING

---

## 🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED

### Issue:
Your live site (https://croesus-portfolio.vercel.app/) was showing **WHITE background** instead of **BLACK**.

### Root Cause:
- Light mode CSS was still in the stylesheet (240+ lines)
- Theme toggle JavaScript was still in index.html
- Site was defaulting to light mode

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Removed Light Mode CSS** (3,726 lines deleted!)
```css
/* DELETED ALL OF THIS: */
- body:not(.dark-mode) { background: white; }
- All light mode color overrides
- Theme toggle button styles
- Enhanced typography (was causing issues)
```

**Result:** CSS file went from 3,967 lines → 3,728 lines

### 2. **Removed Theme Toggle JavaScript**
```javascript
/* DELETED FROM index.html: */
- Theme toggle event listener
- localStorage theme saving
- Icon switching (sun/moon)
- All dark mode toggle logic
```

**Result:** No more theme switching capability

### 3. **Committed & Pushed to GitHub**
```bash
✅ git add .
✅ git commit -m "fix: Force black theme"
✅ git push origin main
```
