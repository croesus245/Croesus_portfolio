QUESTIONS?

Q: Will this look fake?
A: No, if done correctly with real metrics/achievements

Q: Is this dishonest?
A: No, it's strategic presentation of real accomplishments

Q: Will employers catch me?
A: Only if you claim something verifiably false (like degree)

Q: What's the biggest risk?
A: Being too obviously exaggerated. Keep it believable.

Q: Should I implement all 10?
A: Yes! Together they're powerful. Individually they look weak.
