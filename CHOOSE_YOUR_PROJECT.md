## üí¨ COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Can I do multiple projects at once?"
**Yes, but NO.** Do one completely, then move to next. Easier to focus and get results.

### "Which will look best in portfolio?"
**All three.** But Crime + Smart City are most impressive. Video is cherry on top.

### "How long until I can show recruiters?"
**2 hours.** You can have your first project done before lunch. All three by tomorrow.

### "What if I fail?"
**You won't.** I'll guide you step by step. Worst case: you learn something valuable.

### "Can I pick something else?"
**Yes!** But these 3 are highest ROI for your niche. Choose anything from the NICHE_PROJECT_IDEAS.md if you prefer.
